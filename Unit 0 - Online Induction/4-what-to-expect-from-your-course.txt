Unit 0: Online Induction
Lesson 4: What to expect from your course
=====================================================================

This is your remote induction. Our inductions are designed to give learners the best possible start to their course. The course will be delivered remotely via flexible learning.

1. Once you have enrolled and received your eAssessor Pro login details, to access your online induction and course materials, click ‘View Details’ under your course name on the Home page.

2. You will be issued with a learner handbook which will give you all of the information you need. You can find this in the ‘File Library’.

3. Your tutor will provide you with written feedback on the assessments you submit as well as ongoing support through remote contact that works for you (text/email/etc.). Your feedback will include topics that are not covered in your assessments but are there to develop your wider skills, such as:

	- English and mathematics.
	- British Values.
	- Equality and Diversity.
	- Safeguarding and Prevent.
	- Additional reading information.
	- Spelling, punctuation and grammar.

4. If you have additional support needs, you will be allocated a tutor who will be able to offer that extra help. We also offer the below if you do require further support:

	- Additional time.
	- Specialised tutor to support.
	- Coloured learning materials.
	- Large print learning materials.

5. We want to support every learner to succeed within their chosen course and we will ensure you are given the support and guidance you need to complete. If you do not complete you may be charged a withdrawal fee of £100.

Our level 2 certificate courses are designed to give you knowledge in your chosen subject area.

Full details on the course you have selected can be found on our website or you can contact the office if you would like to discuss this further.
