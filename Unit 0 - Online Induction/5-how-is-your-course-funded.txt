Unit 0: Online Induction
Lesson 5: How is your course funded
=====================================================================

The course you have enrolled on is funded by the government department known as The Department for Education via a partner organisation called the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) or your local devolved Combined Authority (CA) (if applicable).

The ESFA/CA are responsible for distributing and managing the funding for adult further education (FE) and skills training in England and ensures that the training it pays for supports economic growth. 

The ESFA/CA provides funding to colleges and training providers to deliver FE education and skills training, which includes vocational qualifications for adults, apprenticeships and traineeships.

Click each marker to find out more about what the ESFA/CA does and the eligibility criteria.

=====================================================================

*** Funding ***

The ESFA/CA provides funding for skills training through contracts with more than 1,000 colleges, private training organisations and employers in England.

=====================================================================

*** Eligibility criteria ***

Eligibility criteria includes:

	- Aged over 19 at the time of commencing learning.

	- Lived in the EU for the last three years for purpose other than study (and able to supply a passport).

	- Should not be enrolled on any other similar course including distance learning, or have completed this course before even if this was years ago.

=====================================================================

*** Matched funding ***

In order to be able to draw down AEB funding, the ESFA needs to be able to fund an equal amount of similar activity from its own budgets; this is known as 'matched funding'.

=====================================================================

*** Feedback ***

As well as having our own funding contract, we work with other providers to fund your course and you may have been asked to complete enrolment paperwork from other providers, such as colleges that will draw down the funding for your course. These colleges may contact you to obtain feedback on your experiences.
