Lesson 6: Key policies
=====================================================================

We wanted to highlight some key policies.

=====================================================================

*** Saeguarding ***

We recognise our responsibilities to safeguard the welfare of all people, particularly minors and/or vulnerable adults who study with us, by protecting them from physical, sexual and emotional harm and neglect. 

All our staff, particularly tutors, are expected to be alert to the outward signs of abuse, neglect, exploitation and changes in behaviour and take the appropriate action when necessary.  

If you have concerns about the welfare of yourself or another learner, it is important you report this to one of the Designated Safeguarding and Prevent Leads.

Please note that non-action is not an option.

=====================================================================

*** Prevent ***

We must abide by the Prevent strategy published by the government in 2011 and part of our overall counter-terrorism strategy CONTEST.

The aim of the Prevent strategy is to reduce the threat to the UK from terrorism by stopping people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism – this has simply been expressed as ‘preventing people from being drawn into terrorism’. It is our role to keep you safe and all staff are trained to look for signs of radicalisation and extremist behaviour.  

The Prevent strategy is equally about safeguarding individuals and the country being alert to propaganda activities and working together to develop resilience to extremist influences. 

Extremism is a vocal or active opposition to fundamental societal values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.  

Radicalisation is a process in which individuals or groups come to adopt increasingly extreme political, social or religious ideals that reject the status quo. Terrorism is the unofficial or unauthorised use of violence or intimidation in the pursuit of political, social or religious goals. 

If you are aware of any learner who is being influenced by another or you are feeling vulnerable yourself, it is important you report this to one the Designated Safeguarding and Prevent Lead.

=====================================================================

*** Equality and diversity ***

We welcome all learners. The Equality Act 2010 protects certain characteristics which include age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, sex and sexual orientation. We expect all learners to recognise and respect all individuals.

If you would like more information on equality and diversity, or feel you would like to talk to someone about our Equality and Diversity Policy, please contact the office or visit our website where a copy is available.

=====================================================================

*** British values ***

Our training programmes go beyond the actual knowledge and skills we enhance by developing learners of all ages in their roles as citizens within their workplaces and communities. British values is an all-encompassing term and includes:  

- Individual liberty — freedom of speech.
- The rule of law — no one is above the law, the law is there to protect everyone and people are innocent until proven guilty.
- Democracy — your opinion counts.
- Respect and tolerance — all backgrounds and cultures, all ages, genders, sexualities and all religions and beliefs.

=====================================================================

*** E-safety ***

We are committed to e-safety and raising awareness of how you can be a victim of an activity that utilises ICT to endanger your personal safety, mental health or financial well-being, or that of another individual. Infringements of the policy may include:  

- accessing inappropriate content  
- cyberbullying or harassment   
- fraud or identity theft
- data protection.

It is important to keep safe, respect others and report any incidents of concern to a member of staff.
