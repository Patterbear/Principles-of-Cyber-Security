Unit 0: Online Induction
Lesson 8: What happens when you gain access to your course materials?
=====================================================================

When you begin to access your course materials to complete your learning and assessments, the following things will happen:

1. Welcome: You will receive a welcome email from eAssessor Pro notifying you of your enrolment.

2. Tutor contact: Your tutor will shortly meet with you to introduce themselves. It is their role to encourage you to set self-stretching targets. They are at hand to provide support and guidance where required. They will provide robust written feedback via the online portal, and will provide information on developing your wider skills.

3. Quality checks: An internal quality assurance representative will quality check your work to ensure it has been accurately and fairly assessed by your tutor.

4. Certification: The awarding body’s external quality assurance representative will check that we are working fairly and to the specified standards. They will audit your work before allowing us to award a certificate.

5. Receiving your certificate: After internal and external quality assurance, the learning provider will apply to the relevant awarding body for your certificate; it may take up to six months for you to receive your certificate. If you change your address, you must let us know. If your certificate does not reach you and a reprint is required, this could incur a cost.

*** Guide to assessment questions ***

To meet the course content, the key words in assessment questions must be met. 

Please ensure you show your knowledge by providing enough information to meet the key words. Answers that are not given in enough detail to meet these key words will result in a resubmission.

1. Describe:

If you are asked to describe something, you should state the features in such a way that another person could recognise what you are describing if they saw it. 

An example might be: ‘Describe a donkey’. It would be insufficient to state ‘Four legs and a back’, as this could be a chair. 

A description stating ‘A four-legged animal, long tail, mane, similar to a horse, but generally smaller, eats grass, hay and makes a unique sound as in eeyore or heehaw, often repeatedly’ would probably allow another person to recognise it as a donkey.

2. Define:

If you are asked to define something, you should describe it in such a way that a reader could follow what you are saying and arrive at the same point as you. It often relates to the classification of objects into groups and categories or the meaning of something.   

An example might be: ‘Define how medicines are classified’. The answer would include naming the different categories and then giving some examples of each category.

3. Explain:

Give details to make clear what you are saying in plain English. This requires the most in-depth answer as a general rule.

4. State:

Usually requires a shorter answer, which could be a list or a single sentence. Several questions will take the form of ‘State what the abbreviation BBC stands for’. The answer would be ‘British Broadcasting Corporation’.

5. Outline:

Needs a brief answer which does not include much detail, but covers all steps, stages or parts involved. 

A question asking you to outline how to catch a train to York would require an answer along the lines of: ‘Check train times, choose a train, go to the station, buy a ticket and board the train.’  

It would not expect you to include the details of how you would check the train times, how you would get to the station, buy your ticket and board the train.

6. Identify:

Give sufficient detail so that someone else can recognise your description. This is sometimes used instead of ‘list’ or ‘state’ so think what the question is asking for.  

7. List:

Your answer should give an item-by-item record of names or things that are written one below the other.
