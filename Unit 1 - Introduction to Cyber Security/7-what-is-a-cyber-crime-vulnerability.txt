Unit 1: Introduction to Cyber Security
Lesson 7: What is a cyber crime vulnerability?
=====================================================================

A vulnerability is an oversight by an individual or a flaw or weakness in a system or network that could be exploited by a threat actor to cause damage, or allow an attacker to manipulate the system in some way. Individuals, organisations and nations all have different, but often overlapping, areas of vulnerability.

=====================================================================

*** Vulnerabilities faced by individuals ***

In terms of cyber security, one of the biggest vulnerabilities is people themselves. Lack of IT knowledge or lack of training can lead to people becoming an easy target for threat actors. The opening of emails and files which contain malware have led to numerous cyber security incidents in recent years, such as the ‘WannaCry’ malware attack on the NHS in 2017, which also affected computers in a further 149 countries. Individuals may also not have the latest security patches on their computers. Because fraudsters are coming up with new scams all the time, it can be very difficult for individuals to keep up with the latest types of attack and protect themselves.

=====================================================================

*** Internet of Things (IoT) ***

The Internet of Things (IoT), a system of interconnected devices is another area of risk. The IoT encompasses many ‘smart’ devices, such as Wi-Fi capable refrigerators, printers, manufacturing robots, webcams and cars.

The issue with these devices is that they can be hijacked to carry out further attacks. Worryingly, many businesses do not even realise just how many IoT devices they have on their networks – meaning that they have unprotected vulnerabilities that they are not aware of. These devices could represent a massive opportunity to attackers and a massive risk for businesses.

Example:

The iKettle, made by UK company Smarter, allows users to turn their kettles on and off using a smartphone app – to avoid wasting valuable seconds waiting for the water to heat.

However, a UK security firm has found that the kettles can be used as an entry point for hackers, allowing them to take over a home Wi-Fi network. Specifically, it is possible for hackers to gain access to users’ wireless network key, which in turn can give them access to the network.

=====================================================================

*** Vulnerabilities faced by businesses and organisations ***

For any organisation, there are a number of cybersecurity threats and network vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.

These include:

- Flaws – These are vulnerabilities in software and applications that include coding errors. A market has grown in software flaws, with detailed information on some fetching hundreds of thousands of pounds. These may also include zero-day vulnerabilities, which are software vulnerabilities where there is no patch yet in place to fix it.

- Network vulnerabilities – These result from insecure operating systems and network architecture. This type of vulnerability includes flaws in servers and hosts, misconfigured wireless network access points and firewalls, and flaws in network protocols.

- Features – Common features may be those intended to improve the user’s experience, help diagnose problems or improve management, which can also be exploited by an attacker. For example, JavaScript, which is widely used to develop dynamic web content, can be used by attackers to divert the user’s browser to a malicious website, and for hiding malicious code.

- User error – This is by far the most common vulnerability for all types of companies. Common issues include:

	- Having weak login credentials, e.g. choosing a common or easily guessed password.
	- Leaving laptops or mobile phones unattended in a public place.
	- Opening email attachments from an unknown sender.
	- Leaving passwords in the open, such as on sticky notes.
	- Giving all employees access to everything, or having too many people with administrator access.
	- Exposure to social engineering/phishing attacks.
	- Lack of effective employee training.
	- Not updating systems and antivirus software.

- Charities – Suffering a data breach is serious for any organisation. Yet for charities, whose success is built upon their reputations and the goodwill of supporters, the loss of any sensitive information can be devastating. Charities often hold sensitive information, such as names, addresses and payment details, and may spend less on training and IT infrastructure.

- International organisations and multi-national organisations – In addition to all of the vulnerabilities listed above, these may also be vulnerable to being targeted by government-sponsored hackers trying to keep tabs on the organisation, or hacktivists looking to publicise their own views.

=====================================================================

*** Vulnerabilities faced by nations ***

The risk of cyber attacks on governments is very high, and growing, as hackers develop more sophisticated tools. Many of the attacks faced by governments are not orchestrated for money, but for information or control – making the stakes for governments very high. This so-called ‘cyber warfare’ may be conducted for a variety of reasons, often to extract information, for money, to test vulnerabilities to a ‘hard’ attack, disrupt the economy, create national trauma or insecurity, or to engage in social engineering, such as influencing an election.

Threat actors who target nations are often well-financed and have support from a particular nation.

One area of vulnerability for nations is that systems for different departments are often linked together, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive systems by attacking ones that are less well-protected. Because governments tend to have large and unwieldy bureaucracy, this can also make them slow to adopt the latest cyber defences or to upgrade outdated systems.

Governments also have a huge number of employees and people with access to various systems, making them vulnerable to the same type of techniques used against individuals and companies.

=====================================================================

*** Case study ***

In 2020, it was reported that implantable cardiac devices made by St Jude Medical were found to have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. Devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators had a transmitter that read the device’s data and shared it remotely with a physician. 

This transmitter had vulnerabilities which could allow hackers to gain access to the devices and interfere with their functions, such as using up the battery or giving incorrect pacing or shocks.
