Lesson 2: Differences between a LAN and a WAN
=====================================================================

The main difference between a LAN and a WAN is that a LAN connects local devices to each other, while a WAN connects LANs to each other, usually across multiple locations spread over large distances. A WAN may be limited to one corporation or organisation, or it may be accessible to the public, like the Internet. 

A LAN is used because:
- Computer resources like hard-disks, DVD-ROM, and printers can share local area networks which reduces the cost of hardware purchases.
- You can use the same software over the entire network instead of purchasing the licensed software for each client in the network.
- Data of all network users can be stored on a single server hard disk.
- It is easy to transfer data and messages over networked computers.
- Managing data from one location improves security.
- LAN users can share a single Internet connection.

Drawbacks to using a LAN:
- The LAN administrator can check the data files of every LAN user, which reduces privacy.
- A LAN network can reduce costs by sharing computer resources. However, the initial cost of installing Local Area Networks may be high.
- Unauthorised users can access critical data of the company in case LAN admin is not able to secure a centralised data repository.
- A LAN needs constant administration as there may be issues related to software setup and hardware failures.

A WAN is used because:
- It covers a larger geographical area, which helps facilities located far apart to communicate more easily.
- It can include devices like mobile phones, laptops, tablets, computers, gaming consoles, etc.
- It allows software and resources to be shared by connecting with various workstations.
- Information and files can be shared over a larger area.

Drawbacks to using a WAN:
- The initial set up cost of a WAN network is high.
- It can be difficult or expensive to maintain a WAN network as you need skilled technicians and network administrators.
- It can take more time to resolve issues because of the involvement of different types of technologies.
- It offers lower security compared to other types of networks.
