Unit 3: Understand Legal and Ethical Aspects of Cyber Security
Lesson 1: Key UK legislation relating to cyber security
=====================================================================

The UK has a number of different pieces of key legislation which cover various aspects of cyber security:

- The Computer Misuse Act 1990

- The Data Protection Act 2018/GDPR

- Official Secrets Act 1989

- The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003.

=====================================================================

*** Computer Misuse Act 1990 ***

The Computer Misuse Act 1990 protects personal data held by organisations from unauthorised access and modification. The four clauses cover a range of offences including hacking, computer fraud, blackmail and viruses.

The act makes the following illegal:

- Unauthorised access to computer material. This refers to entering a computer system without permission (hacking).

- Unauthorised access to computer materials with intent to commit a further crime. This refers to entering a computer system to steal data or destroy a device or network (such as planting a virus).

- Unauthorised modification of data. This refers to modifying or deleting data, and also covers the introduction of malware or spyware onto a computer (electronic vandalism and theft of information).

- Making, supplying or obtaining anything which can be used in computer misuse offences.

- Failure to comply with the Computer Misuse Act can lead to fines and potentially imprisonment.

The Computer Misuse Act was first proposed when computers were a rarity in public life, and as a result, it used a fairly narrow definition of what was considered a malicious act. The rise of the digital age since the Act’s passage has led to the insertion of a number of new sections.

In 2015, the Computer Misuse Act was amended to create a new offence of unauthorised acts causing serious damage; to bring the EU Directive on Attacks against Information Systems into UK law; and to clarify the protections for law enforcement if they break into a computer in the course of a criminal investigation.

The new offence of unauthorised acts causing serious damage was made partly to increase the penalties for the kinds of attack that might by classed as cyber terrorism.

The changes made in regard to the EU Directive on Attacks Against Information Systems focused on making it easier to prosecute cyber criminals who were using the UK as a base (even if they weren’t physically located in the UK) as well as to allow the police and Crown Prosecution Service to pursue and prosecute UK residents for cyber crimes committed abroad.

The final provision was more controversial. Civil rights groups have argued that it gives an exemption under the law to police and spy agencies.

*** Data Protection Act 1998 ***

In the 1990s, as more organisations began using digital technology to store and process personal information, there was a growing danger this information could be misused. The Data Protection Act of 1998 was designed to tackle this issue. 

Data stored electronically is vulnerable as it is very easy to copy it to a removable drive or to email or transfer it via the Internet. Individuals who had data stored had several concerns:
	- Who could access this information?
	- How accurate was the information?
	- Could it be easily copied?
	- Was it possible to store information about a person without that individual’s knowledge or permission?

The Data Protection Act 1998 aimed to safeguard information held about an individual classified as personal (e.g. name, address, financial details) or sensitive (e.g. ethnicity, political opinion, religion). The act ensures data stored is processed fairly and lawfully. 

For example, there are strict rules as to who can access and alter health records. Regular checks are made to ensure that the rules of the Data Protection Act are being followed.

Principles of the Data Protection Act 1998:

1. Data must be collected and used fairly and inside the law.
2. Data must only be held and used for the reasons given to the Information Commissioner.
3. Data can only be used for registered purposes. You cannot give it away or sell it unless this was stated initially. For example, a school could not sell pupils’ data to a book or uniform supplier without permission.
4. The data held must be acceptable, appropriate and not beyond what is necessary when compared with the purpose for which the data is held.
5. Data must be accurate and be kept up to date. For example, making sure contact numbers are current.
6. Data must not be kept longer than is necessary. This rule means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers longer than a few years at most.
7. Data must be kept safe and secure – for example, personal data should not be left open to be viewed by just anyone.
8. Data may not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area unless the country where the data is being sent has similar data protection laws. This part of the Data Protection Act has led to some countries passing compatible laws to allow computer data centres to be located in their jurisdiction.

Under the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA), individuals have the right to find out what information the government and other organisations have on file. 

These include the right to:
	- be informed about how your data is being used
	- access personal data
	- have incorrect data updated
	- have data erased
	- stop or restrict the processing of your data
	- data portability (allowing you to access and reuse your data for different services)
	- object to how your data is processed in certain circumstances.

The DPA 2018 updated and replaced the Data Protection Act 1998. It was amended again on 01 January 2021, to reflect the UK’s status outside the EU.

The amended DPA sits alongside and supplements the UK GDPR – for example, by providing exemptions. It also sets out separate data protection rules for law enforcement authorities, extends data protection to some other areas, such as national security and defence, and sets out the Information Commissioner’s functions and powers.

The law applies to anyone using information about people for any business or other non-household purpose and applies to most businesses and organisations, whatever their size. It does not apply to anyone using information for personal, family or household purposes – such as personal social media activity, private letters and emails, or use of your own household gadgets. For law enforcement and national security organisations, the updated DPA sets out the regulations for processing personal data.

=====================================================================

*** General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ***

The General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into effect in 2018. Essentially, it is an EU regulation that’s designed to further strengthen data protection for everyone in the public, private and third sector, giving more control to individuals over how their data is used.

Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR include:
	- Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing.
	- Anonymising collected data to protect privacy.
	 - Providing data breach notifications.
	- Safely handling the transfer of data across borders.
	- Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance.

In effect, the GDPR set a basic level of standards for all companies and organisations that handle the data of EU citizens.

In the UK, the GDPR was brought into domestic law through the amended version of the DPA (2018) and the UK GDPR (2021). Post-Brexit, the main principles, rights and obligations of the GDPR remain the same. However, there are some new rules for the transfer of personal data between the UK and the EEA.

The GDPR requires that businesses keep personal data secure and only permit third parties access to the personal data if there are sufficient guarantees regarding security. Businesses must put in place safeguards that include physical measures (e.g. firewalls, anti-virus programs, perimeter scanning tools) and organisational measures (e.g. policies and procedures related to cyber security). Businesses are required to protect against unauthorised or unlawful use of personal data and against its loss, destruction and damage.

Failing to implement appropriate security measures to safeguard personal data can result in large fines (up to £20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater).

Enforcement action can be taken even when there has been no cyber attack or data breach.

Any company that markets goods or services to EU residents, regardless of where it is located, is subject to the GDPR regulations. As a result, the GDPR also affects global data protection requirements.

=====================================================================

*** The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 ***

This directive works with the GDPR and sets out more specific privacy rights on electronic communications. It recognises that widespread public access to digital mobile networks and the Internet not only creates new opportunities for businesses and users, but also new risks to their privacy. It is mainly focused on the stopping of spam calls and unwanted marketing communications.

There are specific rules on:
	- marketing calls, emails, texts and faxes
	- cookies (and similar technologies)
	- keeping communications services secure
	- customer privacy such as the telephone directory listings.

=====================================================================

*** What is the Official Secrets Act? ***

The Official Secrets Act 1911–1989 are four legal documents protecting the UK against espionage and the leaking of sensitive government information. 

Offences covered by the acts include spying and sabotage, as well as the disclosure of sensitive information by employees and ex-employees of the security services. The penalty for breaching the Official Secrets Act is a maximum jail term of 14 years if the crime relates to spying or sabotage, and a maximum jail term of two years for offences under the 1989 Act.

In Scotland, the Scotland Act 1998 provides that members of the Scottish Executive and junior Scottish Ministers are to be considered as Crown servants for the purposes of the Official Secrets Act 1989. It also provides that people supplying goods or services for the purpose of office holders of the Scottish Administration are government contractors for the purposes of the 1989 Act.

Who has to sign it?

Employees and ex-employees of the security services, civil servants, law enforcement officers, judges, members of the armed forces and government contractors are among those subject to the Official Secrets Acts.

Even those who have not signed the act are bound by it, and government employees are usually informed they are subject to it in their contracts.

*** Did you know? ***

An Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) document describes how the ICO fined CRDNN Limited with the maximum £500,000 fine for making more than 193 million automated nuisance calls.

The company was raided by the ICO in March 2018, and computer equipment and documents were seized for further analysis of their nuisance call operation.

The subsequent ICO investigation revealed that CRDNN Limited was making nearly 1.6 million calls per day about window scrappage, debt management, window, conservatory and boiler sales between 1 June and 1 October 2018.

According to the ICO, “Some of the calls potentially put people’s safety at risk as they were made to Network Rail’s Banavie Control Centre, and clogged up the line for drivers and pedestrians at unmanned level crossings, who were calling to check it was safe to cross the rails.

The calls were all made from so-called ‘spoofed’ numbers, which meant that people who received the calls could not identify who was making them. The company broke the law by not gaining consent from the phone owners to make those calls and by not providing a valid opt out.

CRDNN Limited came to the attention of the ICO when more than 3,000 complaints were made about the nuisance calls.”
