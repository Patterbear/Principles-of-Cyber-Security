*** Advantages and disadvantages of encryption techniques ***

Data in transit refers to data that is moving from one location to another, such as across the Internet or through a private network.

Data protection in transit is the protection of this data while it’s travelling from network to network or being transferred from a local storage device to a cloud storage device – wherever data is moving, effective data protection measures for data in transit are critical, as data is often considered less secure while in motion.

Data at rest refers to data that is not moving from device to device or network to network, such as data stored on a hard drive, laptop, flash drive, or archived/stored in some other way. Protecting data at rest involves securing inactive data stored on a device or network. While data at rest may be less vulnerable than data in transit, it can also be a more valuable target than data in motion.

In either case, protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest is important, as attackers find increasingly innovative ways to compromise systems and steal data.

*** The role of encryption in data protection in transit and at rest ***

Data can be exposed to attacks both in transit and at rest and requires protection at both times. There are a number of approaches to protecting data in transit and at rest. For example, encryption is a popular tool for securing data both in transit and at rest.

*** Best practices for data protection in transit and at rest ***

While data in transit and data at rest may have slightly different risk profiles, the risk lies primarily in the sensitivity and value of your data; attackers will attempt to gain access to valuable data in whichever state is easiest to breach. That’s why a proactive approach is the safest and most effective way to protect sensitive data.
