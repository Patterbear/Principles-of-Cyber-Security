Unit 5: Understand Methods of Maintaining Cyber Security
Lesson 2: Vulnerability testing
=====================================================================

A vulnerability test or assessment is the process of identifying and prioritising the vulnerabilities in a system. This type of test is performed in different kinds of systems, including IT systems, energy supply systems, communications systems, etc. The tests may be conducted for organisations ranging from small businesses up to large regional infrastructures. 

Vulnerability tests usually include cataloguing the assets and resources of the system; ranking the assets in terms of importance to the organisation; identifying potential threats to each asset or resource; finding the best ways of mitigating or eliminating the threats.  

=====================================================================

*** Vulnerability assessment ***

A vulnerability assessment is a way to evaluate the security risks in the software system in order to reduce the probability of a threat. It is also called vulnerability testing. A vulnerability is any weakness in the IT systemâ€™s security procedures, design, or implementation that may result in systems becoming hacked.

The purpose of a vulnerability assessment is to reduce the possibility for intruders (hackers) to gain unauthorised access. To complete an assessment, a number of different tools are used. The first is a vulnerability scan, which is usually completed along with penetration testing.

=====================================================================

*** Vulnerability scanning ***

A vulnerability scan is an application that identifies and creates an inventory of all the systems (including servers, desktops, laptops, virtual machines, containers, firewalls, switches, and printers) currently connected to a network.

For each device that it identifies, it will also identify the operating system it runs and the software installed on it, along with other key information, such as open ports and user accounts.

Vulnerability scanners will also attempt to log in to systems using default or other credentials, in order to build a more detailed picture of the system.

Once it has built the inventory, the vulnerability scanner checks each item in the inventory against one or more databases of known vulnerabilities to see if any items are subject to any of these vulnerabilities. This identifies if any critical updates have not been applied. The result of a vulnerability scan is a list highlighting any systems that have known vulnerabilities that may need attention.

=====================================================================

*** The vulnerability management process ***

Once a scan has been completed, the information is then used to produce a detailed report. The report would include key information which is extremely useful to IT departments.

This includes:
- identification of vulnerabilities
- evaluation of the risk posed by any vulnerabilities identified, e.g. how much risk is the organisation in currently
- the treatment of any identified vulnerabilities
- reporting on vulnerabilities and how they have been handled, e.g. what has been done and what needs to be completed in the future.

Q1. Can you match the vulnerability testing process terms with their brief descriptions?

A1.
	- A vulnerability assessment -> is a way to evaluate the security risks in the software system to reduce a threat.
	- A vulnerability scan -> identifies and creates an inventory of all the systems currently connected to a network.
	- The vulnerability management process -> is a detailed report including key information which is extremely useful to IT department.
