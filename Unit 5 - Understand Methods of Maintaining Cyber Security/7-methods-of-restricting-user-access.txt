Unit 5: Understand Methods of Maintaining Cyber Security
Lesson 7: Methods of restricting user access
=====================================================================

*** Establish effective account management processes ***

Have a system in place for managing user accounts, including keeping track of special account privileges; documenting user access permissions; and removing or disabling user accounts when no longer required. Unauthorised user accounts should be denied access to applications, computers and networks.

=====================================================================

*** Establish policies and standards for user authentication and access control ***

A strong password and username policy should be developed that balances security and usability. Consider using two-factor authentication. This is a security system that requires two separate, distinct forms of identification in order to access something.

The first factor is a password and the second includes either something you have or something you are – such as a text with a code sent to your smartphone, or biometrics using your fingerprint, face, or retina.

=====================================================================

*** Limit user privileges ***

Use the principle of ‘least privilege’ – granting users the permissions to access only the systems, services and information that they need to fulfil their business role.

=====================================================================

*** Limit the number of privileged accounts ***

Control the number of people who have administrative or highly privileged access. Accounts with a high level of privileges should not be used for high risk or everyday activities, for example web browsing and email. 

Administrators should use normal accounts for standard business use.

=====================================================================

*** Monitor ***

Monitor user activity through the use of logs. Activity logs from network devices should be sent to a dedicated accounting and audit system that is separated from the core network.

=====================================================================

*** Have training and education for employees ***

All users should be aware of the policies on proper account usage and their personal responsibility for following security policies.

=====================================================================

*** Did you know? ***

How Microsoft Windows stops standard users from accessing privileged accounts through UAC.

User Account Control (UAC) is a feature added to Windows. It is designed to improve security by limiting application software to standard user privileges until an administrator authorises a change. 

This way, only applications trusted by the user receive administrative privileges, which should keep malware from infecting the operating system. 

In other words, applications that the user runs do not automatically have administrative privileges unless they are approved beforehand or the user explicitly authorises it.
