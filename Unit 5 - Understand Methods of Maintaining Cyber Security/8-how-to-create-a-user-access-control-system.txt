Unit 5: Understand Methods of Maintaining Cyber Security
Lesson 8: How to create a user access control system
=====================================================================

To protect the privacy and integrity of information stored on a computer, it is important to control who can access the information.

Computer access is managed through user accounts. Each individual user of a computer signs in with their own account. Each user will also be assigned their own username and password. Usernames will often follow a set pattern. For example, firstname.last name@companyname.com. Assigning usernames and passwords is usually the first step in creating a user access control system.

There are different levels of user account, such as administrator or user. The access level depends on the rights or permissions that are assigned to that account.

The system actions that a user can perform are governed by the type of account they sign in with. An administrator account has higher-level permissions than a standard user account, which means that an administrator account owner can perform tasks on a computer that a standard user account owner cannot.

Standard user account credentials allow a user to do things that affect only their own account, including:

- change or remove the password

- change the user account picture

- change the theme and desktop settings

- view files stored in their personal folders and files in the public folders.


Administrator account credentials are necessary to do things such as:

- create, change, and delete accounts

- change settings that affect all of the network’s users

- change security-related settings

- install and remove apps

- access system files and files in other user networks.


Tasks that require administrator permission are indicated in dialog boxes by a Windows security icon.

One of the key reasons for setting up an access control system is to restrict the files and folders a user can access and what they can do with the files. The Windows platform uses NTFS permissions to set up this file access.

NTFS permissions allow detailed control over the files and folders on the system. You can set NTFS permissions on a per file basis, as well as a per folder basis.

To set NTFS permission on a file, you should right click and go to properties then go to the security tab.

To edit the NTFS permissions for a User or Group, click on the edit button.

As you can see, there are a number of NTFS permissions, so let’s review them individually. First, let’s look at setting NTFS permissions on a file.

- Full Control allows you to read, write, modify, execute, change attributes, permissions, and take ownership of the file.

- Modify allows you to read, write, modify, execute, and change the file’s attributes.

- Read and Execute will allow you to display the file’s data, attributes, owner, and permissions, and run the file if it’s a program.

- Read will allow you to open the file, view its attributes, owner, and permissions.

- Write will allow you to write data to the file, append to the file, and read or change its attributes.


NTFS permissions for folders have slightly different options (adapted from How to Geek).

- Full Control allows you to read, write, modify, and execute files in the folder, change attributes, permissions, and take ownership of the folder or files within.

- Modify allows you to read, write, modify, and execute files in the folder, and change attributes of the folder or files within.

- Read & Execute will allow you to display the folder’s contents and display the data, attributes, owner, and permissions for files within the folder, and run files within the folder.

- List Folder Contents will allow you to display the folder’s contents and display the data, attributes, owner, and permissions for files within the folder.

- Read will allow you to display the file or folder’s data, attributes, owner, and permissions.

- Write will allow you to write data to the file or folder’s data and read or change its attributes.
