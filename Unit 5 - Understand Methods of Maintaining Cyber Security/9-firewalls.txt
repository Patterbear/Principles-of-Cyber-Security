Unit 5: Understand Methods of Maintaining Cyber Security
Lesson 9: Firewalls
=====================================================================

A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and allows or blocks specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Firewalls establish a barrier between secured and unsecured networks, such as between a company server and the Internet. By blocking access to unsecured sites, a firewall can prevent malware from being accidentally downloaded.

In protecting private information, a firewall is considered a first line of defence; firewalls are generally designed to protect network traffic and connections, and therefore do not attempt to authenticate individual users when determining who can access a particular computer or network.

=====================================================================

*** Software firewalls ***

Software, or host, firewalls include any type of firewall that is installed on a computer or server rather than a separate piece of hardware. The big benefit of a software firewall is that it’s highly useful for creating customised rules for what can be accessed.

=====================================================================

*** Hardware firewalls ***

Hardware, or network, firewalls act in a manner similar to a network router to intercept data packets and traffic requests before they’re connected to the network’s servers. 

Physical firewalls like this excel at perimeter security by making sure malicious traffic from outside the network is intercepted before the company’s network endpoints are exposed to risk.

The major weakness of a hardware-based firewall, however, is that it is often easy for insider attacks to bypass them. Also, the actual capabilities of a hardware firewall may vary depending on the manufacturer – some may have a more limited capacity to handle simultaneous connections than others, for example, and this can slow down network access.

=====================================================================

*** Some types of firewall ***

Most firewalls use one or more of the following methods to control traffic flowing in and out of the network:

- Packet filtering – Packets are small chunks of data. The firewall software analyses the packets based on a particular set of filters. Packets that meet the criteria are sent through and those that don’t are discarded.

- Proxy service – This is an early type of firewall that acts as a gateway between networks or between an internal and external network. Information requested from the Internet is retrieved by the firewall and then sent to the requesting system.

- Stateful inspection – Instead of examining the contents of each packet, this type of firewall compares key parts of the packet to a database of trusted information. If the packet matches the trusted comparison, the information is allowed through. Otherwise it is discarded.

- Application Gateway – This is a security mechanism that is applied to specific applications, such as Telnet and FTP servers. It secures the server but can slowdown performance.

- Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) – A next generation firewall is a newer class of firewall. It filters Internet and network traffic based on the type of traffic and uses particular ports. NGFWs feature the basic functionalities of a standard firewall but can provide deeper and smarter inspection.

*** Did you know? ***

In Windows and macOS, firewalls are built into the operating system.

Q1. Can name one of the two main types of firewall?

A1. software/hardware

Q2. What does NGFW mean?

A2. next generation firewall

Q3. Can match the types of firewall methods below to their brief descriptions?

A3.
	- Packet filtering -> the firewall software analyses the packets based on a particular set of filters.
	- Proxy service -> a firewall that acts as a gateway between networks or an internal and external network.
	- Stateful inspection -> this firewall compares key parts of the packet to a database of trusted information.
	- Application gateway -> a security mechanism that's applied to specific applications, such as Telnet & FTP servers
	- Next generation firewall (NGFW) -> filters Internet & network traffic based on the type of traffic and uses particular ports.
