=====================================================================

Good teamwork skills can be critical for success in both professional and personal ventures. There will be times where you will have to work with someone else to achieve a goal. When this happens, it is important that you have the skills needed to work effectively with others. 

Some benefits of working with others:

- group members compensate for each otherâ€™s weaknesses and share broad perspectives

- greater opportunity to learn from others

- make it easier to share ideas and brainstorm, so there is a greater opportunity for creativity and innovation

- workloads and large tasks can be shared, often making them go faster

- opportunity to improve communication skills and develop better relations and networking with colleagues.


Some benefits of working alone:

- fewer distractions

- greater efficiency

- no conflicts or personality clashes

- no need to share responsibility

- fewer meetings and other events that can decrease productivity

- more control over how and when you work and over project management.
