Unit 6: Understand Working with Others in Cyber Security
Lesson 3: Ways in which team members can work together to make use of individual strengths
=====================================================================

Within a team setting, it is still important that team members work to their own strengths. It is the bringing together of these individual strengths which makes a team successful.

Individuals who know their strengths tend to create more effective teams.

When team members value each otherâ€™s strengths, they more effectively relate to one another, avoid potential conflicts, boost group working and create positive discussions.

Here are some ways that team members can make use of individual strengths:

- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of individual team members, so that all team members can help each other and work to their strengths.

- Plan projects around the individual strengths of each team member.

- Pair up team members who are strong in one area with members who are weaker in that area, so the weaker member can learn new skills.

- Analyse project performance to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each team member.

- Team members who are strong in one area can offer training in that area.
