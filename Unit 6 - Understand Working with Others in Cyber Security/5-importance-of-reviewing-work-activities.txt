Lesson 5: Importance of reviewing work activities
=====================================================================

Reviewing is the process of going back over the work that has been completed and ensuring it is still fit for purpose and meets the objectives set out at the start.  

This process allows team members to identify whether tasks are on track and whether key targets have been met. It also allows the team to identify what has gone well and what could be improved.

Reviewing is vital in ensuring the best quality work is produced within the timescales set.

Reviewing helps ensure that everyone is working to the same common goal. Work can sometimes veer off-track, and a regular review helps ensure everyone is moving towards the correct end point.

Sometimes a task may be allocated to someone who may not be the most effective. A review of work tasks helps ensure the right people are chosen and work is reallocated when not.
