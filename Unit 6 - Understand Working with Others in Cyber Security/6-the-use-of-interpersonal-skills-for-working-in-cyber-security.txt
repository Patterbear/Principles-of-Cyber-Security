Unit 6: Understand Working with Others in Cyber Security
Lesson 6: The use of interpersonal skills for working in cyber security
=====================================================================

We all use interpersonal skills every day. Interpersonal skills describe how we communicate or interact with other people.

Lots of skills can be defined as interpersonal, including our awareness of ourselves and others; caring about others; collaborating and working with others; having clear communications; conflict management and resolution skills.

Employers often actively look for applicants who can work collaboratively, communicate effectively and have positive relationships with customers and co-workers.

Even if you have a very technical job, such as an IT role, you will need to interact with colleagues or clients regularly, often providing complicated information or having to listen carefully to requirements. Having excellent IT skills on your CV won’t necessarily be enough to get you the job.

IT professionals need to be able to interact successfully with others, as well as manage projects and teams.

*** Some key interpersonal skills  ***

1. Work ethic – having a strong work ethic is viewed favourably by many organisations. 

This can be split into three distinct aspects:

- Professionalism – this incorporates everything from how you present yourself to your appearance and how you treat others.
- Respect – all workplaces will require you to work under pressure at some time or another, and being able to remain calm and respectful under pressure is vital.
- Dependability – employers and team members need to know they can count on you. This includes being on time, being prepared and delivering the work when you say you will.

2. Verbal communication skills – being able to have clear conversations with other staff, managers and customers is essential to being an effective worker. This could include being a good listener, carrying out excellent presentations to customers, or working with other team members effectively.

3. Questioning – knowing when to ask questions, and what questions are important to ask is an important interpersonal skill. You should not be afraid to ask questions, but you should also make sure that you are asking in an effective way, so that you receive the answers you need.

4. Giving information – working effectively with others will often include a willingness to help out team members and clients with answers to questions or practical help. This will create a spirit of collaboration.

5. Clarifying – this includes not being afraid to ask for clarification, as well as being willing to give clarification when asked for it. This may also include showing someone how to do something.

6. Giving and receiving feedback – being open to feedback can help you develop both personally and professionally. View all feedback as a chance to learn. When giving feedback, it is important to focus on being constructive rather than negative.

7. Listening – failure to listen properly can have disastrous consequences, from failing to follow through on a manager’s instructions to not completing a customer’s request. Active listening signals to others that you are taking what they say seriously and are willing to learn from them. It includes giving non-verbal signals, such as nodding and maintaining eye contact. This will build trust as the people you are collaborating with will feel heard.

8. Collaboration – working collaboratively increases productivity and helps deliver better outcomes. Being able to collaborate, particularly in challenging situations, is a real positive for employers and yourself. It shows a clear, positive attitude and an enthusiasm for team working.

9. Conflict management – this is an important skill, especially for those looking at leadership roles. This includes being able to put your views across, or defend the views of others, in a professional and respectful way.

10. Positive attitude – showing positivity, even in difficult situations, is important. It is best not to say anything negative about your current or past employer or colleagues even if you feel strongly about it. Employees with a positive attitude also tend to treat others positively, which creates a more harmonious and friendly working environment.

11. Putting across your own views clearly and appropriately – how you come across to others can speak volumes. Demonstrating kindness and courtesy is a great way of developing long lasting relationships with colleagues and managers.
